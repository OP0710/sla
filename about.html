        <p id="div">Compulation theories laid the groundwork for AI.<br>
            1956: Birth of AI<br><br>
            
            Term "Artificial Intelligence" coined at the Dartmouth Conference.<br>
            Focus on solving mathematical problems using algorithms.<br>
            1960s-1970s: Growth and Challenges<br>
            <br>
            Development of rule-based systems (e.g., "expert systems").<br>
            Limitations in computing power led to the first "AI Winter" (period of reduced interest and funding).
            1980s: Revival<br>
            
            Introduction of Machine Learning (ML) and neural networks.<br>
            Improved algorithms and hardware reignited interest.<br>
            1990s-2000s: Practical Applications<br>
            <br>
            AI systems began beating humans in specific tasks (e.g., IBMâ€™s Deep Blue defeated chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997).<br>
            2010s-Present: Deep Learning Era<br><br>
            
            Explosion of data, advancements in GPUs, and deep learning revolutionized AI.<br>
            AI now powers self-driving cars, virtual assistants, and more.</p>
